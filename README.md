# terraform_occm_provider

This project aims to utilize the [NetApp Cloud Central](https://services.cloud.netapp.com/) api to create/destroy OCCM resources in AWS.

-- OCCM API - https://services.cloud.netapp.com/developer-hub

This project does not aim to directly control or provision instances directly in amazon.
We want to let netapp do whatever they do, and just read status from their api.
